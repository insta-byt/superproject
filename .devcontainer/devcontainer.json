      - Make doclava support baselining of lint issues
        
        There are many existing issues in the docs. Before new errors can
        be forbidden, make it possible to allow pre-existing errors.
        
        The baseline support is very crude -- any mention of a file will allow
        all lint errors in that file. It's my hope to trim the baseline down
        quickly so that this won't be an issue.

  - Floss: Refactor DBus intf and only expose after interal API is ready
    
    This does 2 things.
    
    1. refactor the work of DBus interface registration to a separated
    struct, i.e. InterfaceManager.
    
    2. delay the DBus interface registration until the api is ready.
    
    The reason why (2) is needed is because in many implementations, our
    APIs assume the underlying libbluetooth API is ready when the DBus
    method is called. If we register the API to DBus before it is ready,
    there is a tiny window that clients could poke the API and cause crash
    or get an unexpected result of it.
    
    (1) is just to make implement (2) easier.

  - traced_relay: implement the relay service
    
    This CL implements the relay service as a new binary, traced_relay, for
    taking the place of traced in a guest VM and relaying the producer
    connections to the host tracing service. The relay service listen to the
    producer socket and connects to the "relay socket" to the host. Socket
    connections are opened in pairs. Trace data and control commands are
    relayed back and forth between the connection pair.
    
            tracing service
                   ▲    PERFETTO_PRODUCER_SOCK_NAME
     relay socket  │
                   ▼   PERFETTO_RELAY_SOCK_NAME (tcp or vsock)
            relay service
                   ▲   PERFETTO_PRODUCER_SOCK_NAME
    producer socket│
                   ▼   PERFETTO_PRODUCER_SOCK_NAME
              producers
    
    The relay socket is used only to connect to the host producer port. The
    consumer port isn't supported. Peer credentials (PID and UID) is sent in
    the wire_protocol proto by the relay service.
    
    Setup example:
    * Start traced with producer endpoint on localhost:10001:
      `PERFETTO_PRODUCER_SOCK_NAME=127.0.0.1:10001 traced`
    * Start the relay service that uses unix socket for local producers and
      localhost:10001 for relaying to the remote tracing service:
      `PERFETTO_RELAY_SOCK_NAME=127.0.0.1:10001 traced_relay`
    * Start traced_probes that connects to the unix socket to the relay
      service:
      `traced_probes`
    * Collect a trace using the default consumer socket.
    
    The trace data provided by traced_probes will go over the unix socket to
    the relay service, forwarded to localhost:10001 and then get to the
    tracing service.

  - Add all the missing syscalls.
    
    Rather than keep doing these one-by-one, let's just add everything
    that's in our current bionic uapi headers (from the 6.5 kernel).
    
    We should have switched to musl long before anyone's complaining about
    missing 6.6 syscalls!
    
    Some code assumes that, if you have a syscall number defined, you also
    have the corresponding constants. Drag in enough of those constants to
    keep the build green (just the MFD_ constants).

    bp2build tests should not use bp2build_available:false test deps,

    to stop being converted with bp2build. Instead, such test deps should be
    "stubbed", which effectively treats them like targets in pre-existing
    BUILD files on the filesystem.

    Since libaudiohal@aidl reports that the most current legacy C API
    version is supported by the HAL, the audio server uses a different
    logic for telephony scenarios than for the HIDL HAL. This involves
    opening more streams on the same mix port. Allow opening
    an unlimited number of streams. However, keep the number of active
    streams to be `1`.

    The CL makes the following changes:
    
    1. Uprev rustc version to 1.72.0.
    2. Make linker flag optional for CC toolchain. Rustc can generate the
       needed linker flags. In most caess there's no need to specify
       ourselves.
    3. Use lld directly for linking instead of clang/clang++ frontend. rustc
       1.72.0 starts using windows style linker argument which does not get
       recognized by clang/clang++ frontend.

    barriers. Also implement resolution and initialization
    entrypoints and enable codegen for certain instructions to
    allow stress-testing the Baker read barrier implementation.
    
    Fix `CodeGeneratorRISCV64::Finalize()` to avoid finalizing
    the code twice. This double finaization bug was exposed by
    enabling compilation of some larger methods.

  - Wait for process to exit before unmounting postinstall partition
    
    When postinstall action is cancelled, update_engine sends SIGKILL to
    postinstall scripts and immediately unmounts postinstall partition.
    However, if the subprocess hasn't exited yet when we attempt to
    unmount, there might be open file descriptors preventing the unmount

  - Upgrade googletest to most recent upstream version.
    
    Changes needed to complete the upgrade:
    
    - Bump GMock C++ version to C++14.
    - Set gmock_tests to C++14 to work around an issue with
      ExpectCallTest.NonMoveableType, which fails to compile
      with the current AOSP compiler.
    - Disable -Wthread-safety-negative for the Notification type
      (breaks code that enables -Werror).
    - Disable -Wfloat-equal in AppropriateResolution (ditto).
    - Disable -Wuser-defined-warnings for the pointer printer
      to avoid errors in mock methods from the std namespace
      manipulation in android-base/logging.h.
    - Temporarily add an inclusion of <iomanip> to
      gtest/internal/custom/gtest-port.h. This header was previously
      included by gtest/internal/gtest-internal.h and many tests
      do not include it explicitly.
    - Remove the newline added in AddTestPartResult so that the
      golden output tests in gtest_isolated_tests do not break.
